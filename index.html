  <h1>Thoughts and ideas to improve something at your school or in your community.</h1>  
    <ul>
        <li> We can grow our own vegatables or fruits in our own garden </li> 
        <li> The school could include more languages to learn in classes as an elective </li>
        <li> The school could provide more gym equipment, specifically badminton rackets and birdies </li>
        <li> The school can make school events free to enter, but with the requirements of no more than 1 failing class </li>
        <li> The school should keep raising awareness and support to worldwide struggles </li>
    </ul>
       <p> Overall I love how safe the environment at school is and how they strive towards raising awareness. </p>
